    question: "How does Puddl3 work?",
    answer: "Your team clocks in and their wages start accumulating in real time. Instead of waiting for a pay cycle, workers can see what they've earned and take it home whenever they want. Payroll runs itself in the background.",
  },
  {
    question: "When can workers actually get their money?",
    answer: "Any time. There's no payday and no waiting period — earnings are available the moment they're earned. A worker can cash out mid-shift, after work, or let it build up. It's their call.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it cost employers anything?",
    answer: "Offering instant pay costs you nothing extra. Puddl3 turns payroll from a burden into a benefit you can give your team — one that helps you attract and keep good people without adding to your bill.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why does instant pay matter to my team?",
    answer: "Life doesn't wait for the 1st and the 15th. When people can reach the money they've already earned, they stay longer, stress less, and stop asking for advances. Faster pay is one of the simplest benefits you can offer.",
  },
  {
    question: "How hard is it to get started?",
    answer: "Minutes, not weeks. Create an account, add your team, and start streaming wages. There's nothing for your workers to install to see their earnings grow and cash out.",
  },
